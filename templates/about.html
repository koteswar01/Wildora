    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            Founded in 1976 by herpetologist Romulus Whitaker and his wife Zai Whitaker, the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust (MCBT) was created as a response to the alarming decline in India‚Äôs crocodile populations due to habitat destruction, pollution, and overhunting. At the time, crocodilians were on the brink of extinction in India.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bank was initially envisioned as a captive breeding center for India‚Äôs three native crocodilian species: the mugger or marsh crocodile (<em>Crocodylus palustris</em>), the saltwater crocodile (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>), and the critically endangered gharial (<em>Gavialis gangeticus</em>). Its mission was to breed these animals in captivity and reintroduce them into secure wild habitats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Located on the scenic East Coast Road south of Chennai, the Croc Bank began with modest enclosures and a small team, but rapidly gained international attention due to the success of its breeding programs. Over time, it evolved into a globally respected institution, known for its scientific research, conservation outreach, and unique educational exhibits.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1993, acknowledging its broader conservation role, the organization was renamed the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust and Centre for Herpetology. This reflected its expanded focus beyond crocodiles, incorporating turtles, snakes, lizards, amphibians, and even field conservation projects across India and Southeast Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, the Croc Bank is home to 15 species of crocodilians‚Äîthe most diverse collection in Asia‚Äîincluding three species classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. It also maintains breeding populations of threatened turtles and houses one of the largest collections of reptiles in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a hybrid conservation facility, zoo, and research center, MCBT has trained numerous young conservationists, published dozens of scientific papers, and served as a model for community-engaged conservation. It remains one of the most visited wildlife facilities in India and continues to evolve through strategic masterplans and public support.

        <h3>A Thriving Bird Sanctuary</h3>
        <p>
            The Madras Crocodile Bank Trust isn't just a haven for reptiles‚Äîit's also a vibrant sanctuary for birds. Thanks to its tranquil ponds, mature native trees, and dense shrubbery, the Croc Bank has become an unexpected paradise for avian life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over <strong>60 species of birds</strong> have been recorded on the premises, making it a favorite spot for birdwatchers and researchers alike. These include a wide variety of resident species as well as migratory visitors during the winter season.
        </p>
        <p>
            Common sightings include:

        </p>
        <p>
            The lush vegetation‚Äîincluding neem, tamarind, sacred fig, and peepal‚Äîoffers excellent roosting and nesting habitats. Many birds return to the same trees each year, forming part of a long-standing local ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors often remark that the constant chorus of birdsong provides a peaceful and immersive backdrop to their experience, blending seamlessly with the ambient croaks and splashes of the reptilian residents.

        <h3>A Living Herpetofaunal Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>
            While the Croc Bank is best known for its captive reptiles, it also functions as a living habitat for a remarkable variety of <strong>free-ranging wild reptiles and amphibians</strong>. These creatures thrive in the site‚Äôs carefully preserved natural landscapes, creating a unique coexistence between managed conservation and wild ecology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over <strong>35 species</strong> of reptiles and amphibians have been recorded roaming freely across the premises. Some of these are drawn by the natural ponds, forested trails, and open grass patches that mimic their native habitats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Species commonly seen include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Venomous snakes:</strong> Common Krait, Russell‚Äôs Viper</li>
            <li><strong>Non‚Äëvenomous snakes:</strong> Indian Rat Snake, Green Vine Snake, Cat Snake</li>
            <li><strong>Lizards:</strong> Oriental Garden Lizard, Skinks, Indian Chameleon</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Lizards:</strong> Indian Monitor, often seen basking or foraging</li>
            <li><strong>Amphibians:</strong> Indian Bullfrog, Common Indian Toad, Tree Frogs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These wild residents play an important role in maintaining ecological balance‚Äîacting as natural pest controllers, pollinators, and indicators of environmental health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of these species are spotted along the wooded trails, around the central pond, or near the less-trafficked enclosures. The Croc Bank‚Äôs commitment to native vegetation and low-impact landscaping ensures that these wild animals continue to thrive alongside their captive cousins.
        </p>
        <p>
            The presence of these free-ranging reptiles and amphibians not only adds to the biodiversity of the site but also offers <strong>invaluable research and education opportunities</strong>. Visitors on guided nature walks often encounter these elusive creatures, making their visit even more memorable and immersive.
